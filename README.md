This is a simple web-based number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is correct or incorrect, and a scoring system tracks the player's progress.

How It Works
When the page loads, a random number between 1 and 10 is generated.

The user enters a number in the input field and clicks the "Check" button.

The game compares the input with the random number:

If the guess is correct, the player is congratulated, and an alert message indicates victory.

If the guess is incorrect, the player is prompted to try again, and their score decreases by 1.

The "Retry" button resets the game with a new random number and restores the score to 10.
